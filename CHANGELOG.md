# Changelog

All notable changes to Barrelman are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Entries accumulate under `[Unreleased]` as work lands. Cutting a version stamps
that section with the version and date — `scripts/changelog.sh release X.Y.Z`
does it — and the release pipeline turns it into the GitHub Release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Each account's usage is visible from the console's accounts page — the current
  billing cycle broken down by endpoint group and by key, a lifetime total
  beside it, and the account's API keys and moderation history in the same
  place. An account that was abusive last month reads as spotless through a
  cycle window, which is why the lifetime figure is there
* Accounts can be deleted outright, not only suspended. Deleting erases the
  account's keys, usage, credit ledger, abuse signals and its own moderation
  history, so it is the answer to "remove me" rather than to a troublesome
  customer — suspension remains the reversible option, and the one that keeps a
  record. The console asks for the address typed back and the API checks it;
  your own account and the last remaining administrator are both refused

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-28

First tagged release. Barrelman has been running in production for some time;
this is the point at which its images stop being "whatever was last pushed to
main" and start carrying a version you can pin to and roll back from.

### Added

* **Search** over an OSM extract — full-text, trigram, abbreviation and optional
  semantic vector matching in one pipeline, with point-radius and
  route-corridor modes
* **Geocoding**, forward and reverse, backed by Pelias where it is deployed
* **Brand search**, resolving chains and franchises against a brand catalog
* **Places** by OSM id, with the spatial relationships around them — which areas
  contain a point, and what an area contains
* **Vector tiles** through Martin, from the same extract everything else reads
* **Routing** for car, bike and foot through GraphHopper, with elevation and
  path detail
* **Transit** — trip planning through MOTIS, plus live GTFS-RT vehicles,
  departures, stops and route detail
* **GBFS** — shared bike and scooter systems, and live station availability
* **Accounts, API keys and metering** — per-key scopes and origin restrictions,
  credit-based quotas, plans, and usage the account holder can see
* **Abuse controls** — six layers of throttling, automated detection that raises
  signals rather than banning anyone, and moderation with an audit trail
* **Admin console** — imports, migrations, a serial job queue with live logs,
  scheduled jobs, region management, data metrics and downstream service health
* **Self-hosting documentation** at [docs.barrelman.dev](https://docs.barrelman.dev),
  covering install, import, configuration and the failure modes operators hit

### Notes

Billing is gated on a signed licence and is not part of a self-hosted
deployment. Everything above is not.
